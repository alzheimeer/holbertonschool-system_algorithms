/**
 * dijkstra_graph - function that searches for the shortest path from
 *  a starting point to a target point in a graph.
 *
 * @graph: is a pointer to the graph to go through
 * @start: is a pointer to the starting vertex
 * @target: is a pointer to the target vertex
 * Return: return a queue, in which each node is a char * 
 *  corresponding to a vertex, forming a path from start to target
 * You’ll have to use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path
 * You’ll have to print each visited vertex as in the example below
