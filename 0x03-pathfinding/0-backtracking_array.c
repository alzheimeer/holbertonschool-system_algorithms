 * A 1 represents a blocked cell
 * @rows: and cols are respectively the number of rows and columns of map
 * @cols: and cols are respectively the number of rows and columns of map
 * @start: stores the coordinates of the starting point
 * @target: stores the coordinates of the target point
 * For each visited cell, youâ€™ll have to explore neighbour cells in the
 * following order:RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT, TOP
